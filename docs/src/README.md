# Introduction

Mason compiles a Stratum plugin (BepInEx plugins that leverage Stratum) from a project directory. The resulting DLL fits into the BepInEx ecosystem identically to that of a hand-written DLL; it boasts all the same features as a handwritten BepInEx plugin, such as dependencies, incompatibilities, and process name restrictions, with much less of a hassle to setup and maintain.

## Project Snippets

This book contains many examples of Mason project file features. To keep things concise, only relevant lines are displayed. Other information, most notably the `version: 1` at the beginning, may be required but not shown.
