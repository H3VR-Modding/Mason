# Getting Started

The Getting Started unit is a pragmatic approach to learning the basics of Mason. It details, start to finish, how to create a Thunderstore package using Mason.  
The chapters consist of:

- [**Installing**](installation.md) Mason
- [**Preparing**](preparation.md) a Mason project
- [**Compiling**](compilation.md) the project into a runnable Stratum plugin
- [**Adding assets**](asset_management.md) to create a noticable effect on the game
- [**Adding dependencies**](dependencies.md) for required plugins
- [**Packaging**](packaging.md) the final result
