# Getting Started

The Getting Started section is a pragmatic approach of learning Mason. It details start to finish how to create a Thunderstore package using Mason.  
The pages detail how to:

- [**Install**](installation.md) Mason
- [**Prepare**](preparation.md) a Mason project
- [**Compile**](compilation.md) the project into a runnable Stratum plugin
- [**Add assets**](asset_management.md) to create a noticable effect on the game
- [**Add dependencies**](dependencies.md) for required plugins
- [**Packaging**](packaging.md) the final result
