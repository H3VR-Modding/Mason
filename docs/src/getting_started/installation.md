# Installation

Before Mason can be used, it first needs to be installed.  

Mason can be found on [Thunderstore](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/Stratum/Mason/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/H3VR-Modding/Mason). **It is recommended and assumed that you are r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager**, as the Stratum ecosystem leverages the Thunderstore ecosystem extensively.  
It is recommended to create a new profile for the sole purpose of running Mason. This keeps start times slim and lowers the chances of a mod conflict while you are still developing your mod, but always remember to test your mod for conflicts later!
