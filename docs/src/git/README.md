# Version Control with Git

Version control is essential to any long-lasting project. As the name implies, it manages versions of the project files. This allows an entire project to be reverted to an earlier point in time.

Git is by far the most popular version control system. Like any other directory, Git can be initialized within a Mason project. Git also has the added benefit of being hostable on Git hosts such as GitHub, allowing for community collaboration on mods.

This book will not cover how to use Git, as there are already mountains of information on the subject that have been constructed much better than anything could be here. The rest of this section will assume you have a basic understanding of Git.
