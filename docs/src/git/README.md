# Version Control with Git

Version control is essential to any long-lasting project. As the name implies, it manages versions of the project files. This allows an entire project to be reverted to an earlier point in time.

Git is by far the most popular version control system. Git may be initialized within a Mason project like any other directory. Git also has the added benefit of being easily hostable on websites such as GitHub, allowing for community collaboration and additional documentation for your mod.

This book will only cover Git features specific to Mason, not how to use it. There are already mountains of information on the subject that have been constructed much better than anything possible here.
