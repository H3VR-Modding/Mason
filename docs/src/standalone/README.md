# Standalone

Up until this point, only the patcher plugin has been used. While the patcher plugin is very easy to begin with, it leaves much to be desired in relation to its workflow. Needing to launch the game to compile a mod, reading the console for warnings/errors, and manually packaging are possible, but tedious actions.  
The standalone version of Mason aims to streamline the workflow as much as possible, and is even cross-platform!
