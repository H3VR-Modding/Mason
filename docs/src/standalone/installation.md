# Installation

Mason can be installed as a NuGet tool or by downloading the EXE directly.

## NuGet

NuGet is the easiest, but is only available if you have the .NET SDK installed. If you don't know what that is, proceed to the direct download. For those with the SDK, use

```bash
dotnet tool install --global mason
```

to install and

```bash
dotnet tool update --global mason
```

to update.

## Direct Download

Direct download, while primitive, works without any additional programs. Visit [the latest release](https://github.com/H3VR-Modding/Mason/releases/latest) and download the standalone zip for your OS. Extract this to a directory, then add it to your PATH ([for Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-PATH-Environment-Variable-on-Windows)). Adding to PATH ensures Mason can be called from anywhere on your PC.

To update Mason, extract a newer release to the same folder as before. Delete all items before extracting to ensure there are no unused files.
